#Important Notes

- Only CentOS 6 and Ubuntu 12.10 and up have been tested.
- Only a Linux 64-bit version of our software is available at this time.
- Currently, the default install path is valid only on UNIX-like
platforms.

#Requirements


##Hardware

You will need a fast computer with plenty of RAM and disk space. This pipeline
is very CPU and IO intensive, and will require plenty of system memory and
space for output.

##Software

### Build requirements
Installation requires cmake (http://www.cmake.org/), minimum version 2.8

On Ubuntu, this can be installed using:

    sudo apt-get install cmake

On Red Hat 6/CentOS 6, run (as root):

    yum install cmake28

On Fedora (13 and up), run (as root):

    yum install cmake

On archlinux, run:

    pacman -Sy cmake

Additionally you will need GCC version 4.1.2 on Mac/Linux/CYGWIN

### Runtime requirements
The following programs are required for the pipeline to run:

- MySQL client (5.0.95)
- Perl (5.8.8)

A MySQL server is required, but can be hosted on a remote machine.

The Perl `DBI` and `DBD::mysql` modules are required for interacting
with a MySQL server.

TRF is also required, but is downloaded during installation. If for some
reason the download fails, you can download it manually from
[the website](http://tandem.bu.edu/trf/trf407b.linux.download.html)
and save it as `trf407b-ngs.linux.exe` in the build directory (see [Installation](#installation)
below).

#Installation

To build and install to the default directory, simply run the following commands:

    tar xzvf vntrseekN.NN.tar.gz
    cd vntrseekN.NNsrc
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..     # may be cmake28 on some systems
	make install # or sudo make install, if needed

By default, this will install the pipeline to `/usr/local/vntrseekN.NN` (eg,
`/usr/local/vntrseek1.05`).

If you would like to choose a different installation prefix, simply run:

	cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<full path> ..

For example, to install to your home directory, `${HOME}/vntrseekN.NN`, use:

	cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${HOME} ..

**If you installed this pipeline as root, and are creating an INDIST
file** you may need to run it as root unless you give your user
permission to write to the installation directory.

If you installed to a non-standard location, you may need to add
`/path/to/prefix/bin` to your `PATH` variable (eg, if your prefix
was `/opt`, you will need to have `/opt/bin` in your `PATH`).

**IMPORTANT:** for correct execution, please add these lines to the
`[mysqld]` section of the `my.cnf` file and restart mysql process:

    innodb_buffer_pool_size=1G
    innodb_additional_mem_pool_size=20M

# Uninstalling

On UNIX, simply run:

	xargs rm < install_manifest.txt # or sudo xargs rm < install_manifest.txt

from the build directory you created above. The directory will
remain, however, so you will not lose any reference files.
