VNTRseek nests all results for a particular data set
in a folder called `vntr_{RUN_NAME}`. For large scale processing
over multiple data sets, an optional parameter `OUTPUT_DIR` is exposed
for relocating the run folder. This way, the `OUTPUT_DIR` can be
set in a config used for many data sets to redirect them all.
By default, `vntr_{RUN_NAME}` will be created wherever
VNTRseek is called.

The `{RUN_NAME}.db` is the database constructed during the main processing,
containing the complete fasta_reads and various other processing data.

The `{RUN_NAME}_rl{READ_LENGTH}.db` is the final output db.
It has fewer tables, compressed fasta reads,
and if the input used standard illumina headers,
shortened headers.

The vcf files contain the called VNTRs and any ref TRs with support,
respectively.

The `data_out*` folders contains intermediate files
for data used across multiple steps.
