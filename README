# Overview

VNTRseek is a computational pipeline for the detection of VNTRs. Given an input reference set of TRs and a set of next-generation sequencing reads, such as those produced by Illumina, VNTRseek produces a database and a VCF file with VNTR calls.

Currently, input reads in FASTA and FASTQ format are supported. Files must be compressed either using plain gzip (.gz) or gzip then tar (.tar.gz). BAM support is planned.

VNTRseek is also capable of running on clusters, though only the Grid Engine queuing system has been tested. Support for other platforms as pull requests is welcome.
